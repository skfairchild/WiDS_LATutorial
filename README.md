# WiDS_LATutorial
Repository for WiDS tutorial: Linear Algebra in Julia

## Julia und Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks from the tutorial.

In order to use the notebooks:

* Download the notebooks (Click on the green `Code` Button or download as Zip File or use a Git Client such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) oder [Sublime](https://www.sublimemerge.com)).
* Download the newest version of Juila [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
* Start Juila.
* Enter the package manager by putting in `]` in the package manager.
* `add IJulia`
* Leave the package manager with a backspace.
* `using IJulia` 
* `notebook()` 

Then a browser window should open, in which the local saved notebooks can be opened.
